# XAI-PGM-Counterfactuals
This project develops an Explainable AI (XAI) framework using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Counterfactual Analysis to interpret CNN predictions. The approach integrates prototype-based explainability with Bayesian Networks, providing transparent and structured reasoning for deep learning models.
